This is the CAD designs and some sample code for a 6 DOF robot arm I designed and built during fall 2014 while working for Professor Pieter Abbeel at the Robot Learning Lab at UC Berkeley.
It is made of laser-cut MDF and uses hobby servos for a total cost of ~$500. The SolidWorks files include some of the bearings, but no motors, angle-brackets, or springs (for counter-weights).
